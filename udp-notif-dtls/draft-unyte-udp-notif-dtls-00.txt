1.  Introduction

   UDP-notif [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] defines a lightweight
   notification protocol allowing networking devices to send data over
   UDP.  This document describes a layer to secure UDP-notif messages
   between the publisher and the receiver using DTLS 1.3 protocol.

   The DTLS 1.3 protocol [I-D.draft-ietf-tls-dtls13] is designed to meet
   the requirements of applications that need to secure datagram
   transport.

   DTLS can be used as a secure transport to counter all the primary
   threats to UDP based Publication Channel:

   *  Confidentiality to counter disclosure of the message contents.

   *  Integrity checking to counter modifications to a message on a hop-
      by-hop basis.

   *  Server or mutual authentication to counter masquerade.

   In addition, DTLS also provides:

Internet-Draft            unyte-udp-notif-dtls                 July 2021


   *  A cookie exchange mechanism during handshake to counter Denial of
      Service attacks.

   *  A sequence number in the header to counter replay attacks.

   This documents defines the requirements for the implementation of the
   secured layer of DTLS for UDP-notif.  No DTLS 1.3 extensions are
   defined nor needed.

2.  Transport

   As shown in Figure 1, the DTLS is layered next to the UDP transport
   providing reusable security and authentication functions over UDP.
   No DTLS extension is required to enable UDP-notif messages over DTLS.

                      +-----------------------------+
                      |      UDP-notif Message      |
                      +-----------------------------+
                      |            DTLS             |

            Figure 1: Protocol Stack for DTLS secured UDP-notif

   The application implementer will map a unique combination of the
   remote address, remote port number, local address, and local port
   number to a session.

   Each UDP-notif message is delivered by the DTLS record protocol,
   which assigns a sequence number to each DTLS record.  Although the
   DTLS implementer may adopt a queue mechanism to resolve reordering,
   it may not assure that all the messages are delivered in order when
   mapping on the UDP transport.

   Since UDP is an unreliable transport, with DTLS, an originator or
   relay may not realize that a collector has gone down or lost its DTLS
   connection state, so messages may be lost.

   The DTLS record has its own sequence number, the encryption and
   decryption will done by DTLS layer, UDP-notif Message layer will not
   concern this.

3.  Port Assignment

   The Publisher is always a DTLS client, and the Receiver is always a
   DTLS server.  The Receivers MUST support accepting UDP-notif Messages
   on the UDP port PORT-Y, but MAY be configurable to listen on a
   different port.  The Publisher MUST support sending UDP-notif
   messages to the UDP port PORT-Y, but MAY be configurable to send
   messages to a different port.  The Publisher MAY use any source UDP
   port for transmitting messages.

4.  Session lifecycle

4.1.  DTLS Session Initiation

   The Publisher initiates a DTLS connection by sending a DTLS Client
   Hello to the Receiver.  Implementations MUST support the denial of
   service countermeasures defined by DTLS.  When these countermeasures
   are used, the Receiver responds with a DTLS Hello Verify Request
   containing a cookie.  The Publisher responds with a DTLS Client Hello
   containing the received cookie, which initiates the DTLS handshake.

   The Publisher MUST NOT send any UDP-notif messages before the DTLS
   handshake has successfully completed.

   Implementations MUST support DTLS 1.3 [I-D.draft-ietf-tls-dtls13] and
   MUST support the mandatory to implement cipher suite
   TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 and
   TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 cipher suites, as specified in TLS 1.3
   [RFC8446].  If additional cipher suites are supported, then
   implementations MUST NOT negotiate a cipher suite that employs NULL
   integrity or authentication algorithms.

   Where privacy is REQUIRED, then implementations must either negotiate
   a cipher suite that employs a non-NULL encryption algorithm or else
   achieve privacy by other means, such as a physically secured network.

4.2.  Sending Data

   All UDP-notif messages MUST be sent as DTLS "application_data".  It
   is possible that multiple UDP-notif messages be contained in one DTLS
   record, or that a publication message be transferred in multiple DTLS
   records.  The application data is defined with the following ABNF
   [RFC5234] expression:

   APPLICATION-DATA = 1*UDP-NOTIF-FRAME

   UDP-NOTIF-FRAME = MSG-LEN SP UDP-NOTIF-MSG

Internet-Draft            unyte-udp-notif-dtls                 July 2021


   MSG-LEN = NONZERO-DIGIT *DIGIT

   SP = %d32

   NONZERO-DIGIT = %d49-57

   DIGIT = %d48 / NONZERO-DIGIT

   UDP-NOTIF-MSG is defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif].

4.3.  Session termination

   A Publisher MUST close the associated DTLS connection if the
   connection is not expected to deliver any UDP-notif Messages later.
   It MUST send a DTLS close_notify alert before closing the connection.
   A Publisher (DTLS client) MAY choose to not wait for the Receiver's
   close_notify alert and simply close the DTLS connection.  Once the
   Receiver gets a close_notify from the Publisher, it MUST reply with a
   close_notify.

   When no data is received from a DTLS connection for a long time
   (where the application decides what "long" means), Receiver MAY close
   the connection.  The Receiver (DTLS server) MUST attempt to initiate
   an exchange of close_notify alerts with the Publisher before closing
   the connection.  Receivers that are unprepared to receive any more
   data MAY close the connection after sending the close_notify alert.

   Although closure alerts are a component of TLS and so of DTLS, they,
   like all alerts, are not retransmitted by DTLS and so may be lost
   over an unreliable network.

5.  Applicability considerations

   As defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-tls-dtls13], each DTLS record MUST fit
   within a single datagram.  Thus, implementations of the mechanism
   SHOULD size the payload of UDP-notif protocol so that the datagram
   fit within 65535 bytes.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This RFC requests that IANA assigns one UDP port number in the
   "Registered Port Numbers" range with the service name "udp-notif-
   dtls".  This port will be the default port for the UDP-based
   notification Streaming Telemetry (UDP-Notif-DTLS) for NETCONF and
   RESTCONF.  Below is the registration template following the rules of
   [RFC6335] .
