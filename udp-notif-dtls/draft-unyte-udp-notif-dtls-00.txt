   This document describes a DTLS layer for UDP-notif messages.  DTLS
   allows a server and a client to exchange secured messages over UDP.
   This transport layer permits networking devices to send secured UDP-
   notif messages over the network.

1.  Introduction

   UDP-notif [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] defines a lightweight
   notification protocol allowing networking devices to send data over
   UDP.  This document describes a DTLS layer to secure UDP-notif
   messages between the publisher and the receiver.

2.  Using DTLS to secure UDP-notif

   The Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol [RFC6347] is
   designed to meet the requirements of applications that need to secure
   datagram transport.

   DTLS can be used as a secure transport to counter all the primary
   threats to UDP based Publication Channel:

   *  Confidentiality to counter disclosure of the message contents.

   *  Integrity checking to counter modifications to a message on a hop-
      by-hop basis.

   *  Server or mutual authentication to counter masquerade.

   In addition, DTLS also provides:

   *  A cookie exchange mechanism during handshake to counter Denial of
      Service attacks.

   *  A sequence number in the header to counter replay attacks.

2.1.  Transport

   As shown in Figure 2, the DTLS is layered next to the UDP transport
   providing reusable security and authentication functions over UDP.
   No DTLS extension is required to enable UDP-notif messages over DTLS.

   The application implementer will map a unique combination of the
   remote address, remote port number, local address, and local port
   number to a session.

   Each UDP-notif message is delivered by the DTLS record protocol,
   which assigns a sequence number to each DTLS record.  Although the
   DTLS implementer may adopt a queue mechanism to resolve reordering,
   it may not assure that all the messages are delivered in order when
   mapping on the UDP transport.

   Since UDP is an unreliable transport, with DTLS, an originator or
   relay may not realize that a collector has gone down or lost its DTLS
   connection state, so messages may be lost.

   The DTLS record has its own sequence number, the encryption and
   decryption will done by DTLS layer, UDP-notif Message layer will not
   concern this.

2.2.  Port Assignment

   The Publisher is always a DTLS client, and the Receiver is always a
   DTLS server.  The Receivers MUST support accepting UDP-notif Messages
   on the UDP port PORT-Y, but MAY be configurable to listen on a
   different port.  The Publisher MUST support sending UDP-notif
   messages to the UDP port PORT-Y, but MAY be configurable to send
   messages to a different port.  The Publisher MAY use any source UDP
   port for transmitting messages.

2.3.  DTLS Session Initiation

   The Publisher initiates a DTLS connection by sending a DTLS Client
   Hello to the Receiver.  Implementations MUST support the denial of
   service countermeasures defined by DTLS.  When these countermeasures
   are used, the Receiver responds with a DTLS Hello Verify Request
   containing a cookie.  The Publisher responds with a DTLS Client Hello
   containing the received cookie, which initiates the DTLS handshake.

   The Publisher MUST NOT send any UDP-notif messages before the DTLS
   handshake has successfully completed.

   Implementations MUST support DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347] and MUST support the
   mandatory to implement cipher suite, which is
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA [RFC5246] as specified in DTLS 1.2.  If
   additional cipher suites are supported, then implementations MUST NOT
   negotiate a cipher suite that employs NULL integrity or
   authentication algorithms.

   Where privacy is REQUIRED, then implementations must either negotiate
   a cipher suite that employs a non-NULL encryption algorithm or else
   achieve privacy by other means, such as a physically secured network.

2.4.  Sending Data

   All UDP-notif messages MUST be sent as DTLS "application_data".  It
   is possible that multiple UDP-notif messages be contained in one DTLS
   record, or that a publication message be transferred in multiple DTLS
   records.  The application data is defined with the following ABNF
   [RFC5234] expression:

   APPLICATION-DATA = 1*UDP-NOTIF-FRAME

   UDP-NOTIF-FRAME = MSG-LEN SP UDP-NOTIF-MSG

   MSG-LEN = NONZERO-DIGIT *DIGIT

   SP = %d32

   NONZERO-DIGIT = %d49-57

   DIGIT = %d48 / NONZERO-DIGIT

   UDP-NOTIF-MSG is defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif].

2.5.  Closure

   A Publisher MUST close the associated DTLS connection if the
   connection is not expected to deliver any UDP-notif Messages later.
   It MUST send a DTLS close_notify alert before closing the connection.
   A Publisher (DTLS client) MAY choose to not wait for the Receiver's
   close_notify alert and simply close the DTLS connection.  Once the
   Receiver gets a close_notify from the Publisher, it MUST reply with a
   close_notify.

   When no data is received from a DTLS connection for a long time
   (where the application decides what "long" means), Receiver MAY close
   the connection.  The Receiver (DTLS server) MUST attempt to initiate
   an exchange of close_notify alerts with the Publisher before closing
   the connection.  Receivers that are unprepared to receive any more
   data MAY close the connection after sending the close_notify alert.

   Although closure alerts are a component of TLS and so of DTLS, they,
   like all alerts, are not retransmitted by DTLS and so may be lost
   over an unreliable network.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This RFC requests that IANA assigns one UDP port number in the
   "Registered Port Numbers" range with the service name "udp-notif-
   dtls".  This port will be the default port for the UDP-based
   notification Streaming Telemetry (UDP-Notif-DTLS) for NETCONF and
   RESTCONF.  Below is the registration template following the rules of
   [RFC6335] .

   Service Name: udp-notif-dtls

   Transport Protocol(s): UDP

   Assignee: IESG <iesg@ietf.org>

   Contact: IETF Chair <chair@ietf.org>

   Description: UDP-based Publication Streaming Telemetry

   Reference: RFC XXXX

   Port Number: PORT-X


   IANA is requested to assign a new URI from the IETF XML Registry
   [RFC3688].  The following URI is suggested:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-udp-notif
   Registrant Contact: The IESG.
   XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document also requests a new YANG module name in the YANG Module
   Names registry [RFC7950] with the following suggestion:

   name: ietf-udp-notif
   namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-udp-notif-dtls
   prefix: un
